# Ellipses 
In this repository, code of the TCN architecture presented in the paper "The Importance of Multiple Temporal Scales in Motion Recognition:from Shallow to Deep Multi Scale Models" are reported. 


# Requirements 
The TCN architecture code is based on Python and Pytorch.

The TCN model we proposed is able to handle multiple temporal scales for 3 different time series but can easily be extended to handle more.
The code can easily be modified to use fewer or more time series.
